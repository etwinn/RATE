# Data and Code for the Figures in "Interpreting Deep Neural Networks using Variable Importance"

The code and notebooks require the package in [this directory](../../Software/rate-bnn) to be installed.

Each directory contains the code/notebooks used to generate the Figures in [Ish-Horowicz et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09839). These are

* Figure 2 and S2 - Simulation Study
* Figure 3 and S3 - MNIST (binary classification)
* Figure S4 and S5 - MNIST (multiclass classification)
* Figure S6 - IMDB Sentiment Analysis
* Figures S11 and S12 - COMPAS (binary and multiclass classification)
